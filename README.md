# Feature_Engineering
Apply feature engineering methods

# Goal
Using the data available in file concrete_data.xls. Apply feature engineering methods to obtain 85% to 95% accuracy  (tolerance limit 95% of the time (confidence level).

# Resources Available 
The data for this project is available in file https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/concrete/compressive/

# Deliverable -1  (Exploratory data quality report reflecting the following)
1. Univariate analysis
Univariate analysis â€“ data types and description of the independent attributes which should include (name, meaning, range of values observed, central values (mean and median), standard deviation and quartiles, analysis of the body of distributions / tails,  missing values, outliers

2. Multivariate analysis 
Bi-variate analysis between the predictor variables and between the predictor variables and target column. Comment on your findings in terms of their relationship and degree of relation if any. Presence of leverage points. Visualize the analysis using boxplots and pair plots, histograms or density curves. Select the most appropriate attributes

3. Strategies to address the different data challenges such as data pollution, outliers and missing values

# Deliverable -2  (Feature Engineering techniques)

1. Identify opportunities (if any) to create a composite feature, drop a feature

2. Decide on complexity of the model, should it be simple linear mode in terms of parameters or would a quadratic or higher degree help

3. Explore for gaussians. If data is likely to be a mix of gaussians, explore individual clusters and present your findings in terms of the independent attributes and their suitability to predict strength

# Deliverable -3  (create the model )

1. Obtain feature importance for the individual features using multiple methods and present your findings


# Deliverable -4 (Tuning the model)

1. Algorithms that you think will be suitable for this project

2. Techniques employed to squeeze that extra performance out of the model without making it overfit or underfit

3. Model performance range at 95% confidence level
